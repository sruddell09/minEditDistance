# minEditDistance
This is Python program that calculates the minimum edit distance between a source word (correctly spelled word) and target word (incorrectly spelleed word).

It uses simple dynamic programming to calculate the most efficient way to change the target word into the source word.
There are three edit operations used to reach this target word: deletion, insertion, and substitution, each edit operation having an equal cost of 1.

This project was originally created for my Introduction to Natural Language Processing class at San Jose State University.
